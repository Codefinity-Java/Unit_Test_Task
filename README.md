# Task
Your task is to **remove the list creation** from the tests and **write a unit test** that will check if the sorting in the method works correctly. In other words, you need to create a test that will verify how the method behaves **with palindromes of different lengths**.

Don't forget about using the `@Test` annotation and `asserEquals` method.

You need to run the tests, and see if the method passes them successfully.

Good Luck!
